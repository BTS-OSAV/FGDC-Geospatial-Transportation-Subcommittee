Using GTFS to tell your story…  
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and the National Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP) will discuss the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and how it’s being leveraged to collect, compile, visualize, and publish transit, intercity bus, and intermodal passenger travel datasets in a webinar on July 12th, 2018 at 2:00 PM.  
The workshop will clarify GTFS, its significance, and provide hands-on instruction on how to build GTFS compliant data using a free Microsoft Excel application.   The seminar will also provide an overview of GTFS based initiatives at the USDOT and explain how the transit, intercity bus, and intermodal passenger travel communities can contribute to these important projects.  
Anyone with a desire to learn about emerging trends in visualizing fixed route transportation services will benefit from this seminar.
