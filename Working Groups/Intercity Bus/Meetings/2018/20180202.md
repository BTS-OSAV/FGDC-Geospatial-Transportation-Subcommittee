&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Your Mark Transportation  
Working with BB to get on the ABA and NBTA agendas in 2019   
A big thank you to Marcy Jaffe (NRTAP) and Thomas Craig (Trillium).  Marcy gave amazing presentations on What is GTFS and How to GTFS.    Thomas nailed the opening by explaining open data and closing with technology trends.  
Our DOT Fellows are compiling the notes and I’ll email them to the group when they’re finished.  
Charter Busses - Tourist Destinations  
There were a lot of travel companies there.  I’m considering reaching out to that industry and discussing how they could use GTFS as a way of putting themselves on the “map”.  If they have fixed routes and consistent service it might be a way to start to filling our passenger travel gap.  
Thoughts?  
Strictly Charter Only - Demand Response only.  Have market areas but not consistent service.  
Some do offer fixed routes - They belong if the provide scheduled fixed route service  
FTA has to be notified of charter service  
Diversity of operations is not captured  
“Casino Trips” are fixed routes services  
Short Commuter trips - Regularly scheduled trips  
Amtrak thru way  
TransCore Data  
TransCore has started automatically generating GTFS data for their customers.  I believe this group had a big influence on that decision.  Well done and thank you!  
They are willing to add a form on their website that would allow bus companies to opt-into the Intercity Bus Atlas  

4. Intercity Bus Atlas Registration  
The draft partnership language below has been sent to General Council.  Please review and comment.  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJ4w6QsrJixKIcQ-RetvZo7a4765XejY9tEFCgzSAw4/edit?usp=sharing  
We are still waiting on General Council.  I have scheduled a face to face Tuesday of next week in the hopes of nudging them forward.  
If we can pull from TransCore it simplifies the data gathering process; Hopefully things will move faster.  

5. Federal Geographic Data Committee’s (FGDC) Transportation Subcommittee (TSC)  
I would like to move this working group into the FGDCs TSC  
Right now we’re kind of suspended in administrative space.  Placing it under the TSC gives it an administrative home and presents ICB in front of the DOT and FGDC.  
Thoughts and feelings?  
Does not end-up resulting in administrative hurdles  

6. Data  
Intermodal Passenger Connectivity  
Theresa Firestine and I are working on revamping the Passenger Connectivity data.  Considering ways to use, or extend, the GTFS model to capture the stations at which passengers transfer from one mode of travel to another.  
Is there something about intermodal passenger travel this group would like to see?  
Filtered by mode  
Bus to Air  
Bus to Rail  
Bus to other Modes  
Facilities with no connections  
Where are the connection opportunities 
Where are the non documented connection opportunities  
Capture functionally connected but not formally connected stops  
Who and where are the curbside operators within intermodal passenger connectivity?  
Another example is Casino operators/airport shuttles  
Demographic Data  
Theresa Firestine and I are starting to formalize the methodology by which we will calculate the populations served by passenger stations and stops (Catchments).  
Are you interested in seeing how it’s done once we finish?  I.e. Do you want to see how the sausage is made?  
The draft process has been outlined here: https://prezi.com/view/xyLKqrzfpgd6wmeWlck1/  
GTFS Inventory   
We will use a list of commercial carriers from FMCSA to establish a baseline of GTFS providers within the ICB industry  
Below is the Data and Identified Data Gaps Document

7. Outreach  
Working with Marcy Jaffe of the National Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP) to present quarterly Webinars about what is GTFS, how to build GTFS data, and how to participate in the National Transit Map and the Intercity Bus Atlas.  We will focus on non registered Transit agencies and ICB companies.  

8. Conferences and Meetings  
Moving these meetings to every 2 months.   
Will be sending requests for this years meetings.  
I will do a better job of joining the NBTA quarterly conference calls
