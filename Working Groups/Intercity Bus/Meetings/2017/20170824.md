Need to read the grants to get the routes
NRTAP - GTFS building spreadsheet - Convert to web based app
Which contextual layers would you like to see in the application?
Catchments
Is there an industry standard for areas served by Intercity Bus Stations
25 miles by BTS, ~75% riders with in 10 - 15 miles
10 and 25 seems to be the default
Different States ask for differing catchments based population density
Use esri Net Analyst tool to determine drive time to station
Willing to give zip code but not address
New station planning (Middle of market areas)
Colocate near other transportation facilities (mostly transit?)
Is there interest in writing a best practices paper for defining Intercity Bus Station catchments (TRB AP055 - Rural Public and Intercity Bus Transportation)
Research needs statement?
Demographic Data (Census Blocks)
Urban Areas
Legislative Districts
How many routes are funded?  How to get that from DOT?
% of population is served by bus stops within catchments (10 miles, etc…)

5. Licensing
What is the best license option to ensure greatest amount of data use while protecting competitiveness

What is the best method of collecting licenses
Must participants opt-in from a DOT web page?
Can participants opt-in from a third-party webpage?
Can DOT build a tool/plugin that enables users to opt-in from a third party website but is directly connected to the DOT?
Can we add licensing to the GTFS feed_info.txt file

6. Outreach

7. Conferences and Meetings
Next NIBA Meeting is 15 Sept 2017 @ ?
Looks like I’ll  get a budget for next year
Is there an interest in a ½, 1, or 2 day workshop to discuss GTFS data and the intercity busing industry?
If so what topics might we cover
Should we make it coincident with a Busing Conference

8. Tools
Found an ArcMap/ArcPro tool to build stops and routes from GTFS files
http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=380aa7cbf010417ab3ae32a6f11e00d9
A larger tool set can be found here
http://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=d8e84e82803e4c3690c30f9ef0f960fc#overview
As BTS writes code to process GTFS files it will be made available via a BTS web site
