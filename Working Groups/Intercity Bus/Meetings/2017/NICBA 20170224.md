2. Review of initial project proposal
Input from my DOT Colleagues
GTFS may not fit the intercity busing industry - don’t force it.
Publication of standardized intercity busing data would benefit the industry, the riders and the nation.
Consensus that standardized data publication is gaining momentum; encourage proactivity.
No issues with the model
Concerns about competitive edge
Concerns about accuracy of data
Challenge updating schedule and websites, keeping them synchronized is difficult due to a lack of labor
Enable data driven websites based on GTFS files
Requirement by states for providers to give GTFS data for funding
Issue is going to be the mechanism to getting it done
Funding for the development of GTFS tools - or for providers to develop and maintain GTFS Data

Changes in Objectives
Replaced all GTFS references with references to standardized intercity bus data
Changes in scope
Made establishing authoritative data sources a higher priority
Included a section on investigating the industry’s stance on using standardized data.

3. Review of current business
Converting AIBRAs maps to GIS Application	
Production strategies
Cite AIBRA as the source of the data
Develop production schedule
Develop and update schedule
Review Rules for inclusion
Focus on stops, routes, and providers at first, exclude schedule data
Use available GIS data when possible
Use GTFS data when possible
Establish Mapping Team (interns?)
Thought’s on trying to use TRB’s Quick Response projects (Pat/Fred)

4. Propose we move to monthly meetings.
