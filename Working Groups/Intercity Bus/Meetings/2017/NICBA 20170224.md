2. Review of initial project proposal   
Input from my DOT Colleagues   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GTFS may not fit the intercity busing industry - don’t force it.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Publication of standardized intercity busing data would benefit the industry, the riders and the nation.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consensus that standardized data publication is gaining momentum; encourage proactivity.  
No issues with the model  
Concerns about competitive edge  
Concerns about accuracy of data  
Challenge updating schedule and websites, keeping them synchronized is difficult due to a lack of labor  
Enable data driven websites based on GTFS files  
Requirement by states for providers to give GTFS data for funding  
Issue is going to be the mechanism to getting it done  
Funding for the development of GTFS tools - or for providers to develop and maintain GTFS Data  
Changes in Objectives  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Replaced all GTFS references with references to standardized intercity bus data  
Changes in scope  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made establishing authoritative data sources a higher priority  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Included a section on investigating the industry’s stance on using standardized data.  

3. Review of current business  
Converting AIBRAs maps to GIS Application	  
Production strategies  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cite AIBRA as the source of the data  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Develop production schedule  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Develop and update schedule  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Review Rules for inclusion  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Focus on stops, routes, and providers at first, exclude schedule data  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use available GIS data when possible  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use GTFS data when possible  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Establish Mapping Team (interns?)  
Thought’s on trying to use TRB’s Quick Response projects (Pat/Fred)
