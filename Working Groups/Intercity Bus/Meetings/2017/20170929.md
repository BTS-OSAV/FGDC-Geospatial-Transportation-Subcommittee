A Trillium consultant (Aaron or myself) would love to attend a GTFS training workshop as a presenter or trainer in January
Our team has helped the WorldBank on a series of GTFS training materials that could prove a useful resource for the group (need to get link from Aaron they may not be published quite yet)
If anyone has any questions about the GTFS sessions at RTAP I'm in both and happy to provide info/connect you Marcy (the other primary presenter in each of these)
