## Possible Technical Assistance (Grant) to aid Intercity Bus Ticketing 

1.  What problem are we trying to solve?   
Electronic ticketing is a challenge for interlined bus companies because it is not fully implemented; It results in an inconsistent user experience and works for GLI but the interlined companies have difficulty implementing the system.   
GLI website acts as broker for all interlined companies.  
A seat reserved on GLI has to hold a set on a different company.  
Real time capacity management.  
A no show needs to show a free seat immediately.  
Has to benefit the entire industry or at least NBTA.
