### Charter for the FGDC Road Specification Working Group  

#### I. Purpose     
The Road Specification Working Group (RSWG) is established under the auspices of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), Transportation Subcommittee for the development of a national specification for geospatial highway data.     

#### II.  Definition of     
For the purpose of this charter and Working Group, the following definition shall apply:  
HIGHWAY.—The term “highway” includes—  
(A) a road, street, and parkway;  
(B) a right-of-way, bridge, railroad-highway crossing, tunnel, drainage structure including public roads on dams, sign, guardrail, and protective structure, in connection with a highway;  

#### III.  Scope  
The scope of the RSWG is to recommend to the Transportation Subcommittee a geospatial data specification that applies to roads.  
This specification is intended for Federal agencies to consider when developing datasets, databases, and initiatives that require the sharing geospatial road data. Use of a common specification will foster more efficient data sharing across Federal agencies.  
The working title of the road specification shall be the United States Road Specification and will use the acronym (USRS) until adoption.  
The USRS is not a data product. It is not intended to create a common database of roads. It is intended to provide a common framework and data dictionary to foster data sharing.  
IV. Leadership
The agencies initiating, forming, and overseeing the RSWG are the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), the U.S. Census Bureau under the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as well as other agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Although most agencies listed have significant interest in the development of the USRS, the FHWA will chair and lead responsibilities for the working group, and is directly responsible to the Transportation Subcommittee, ensuring compliance with FGDC objectives and guidance.  

#### V.  Membership  
The RSWG shall consist of representatives designated by the Federal agencies that create, finance, and/or collect geospatial road information as part of their mission or have direct application of geospatial road data through legislated mandate. Each member agency of the USRS shall designate its representative, an alternate if necessary, and changes thereto, to the RSWG Chairperson. These Federal members shall have formal voting privileges associated with the working group.  Non-voting membership from other public institutions and from the Local Government, State Departments of Transportation, Tribal Governments, private sector, including universities, shall be encouraged, and these individuals may make significant contributions to the RSWG, as well as to various subgroups that are designated by the RSWG.   

#### VI. Responsibilities  
Create a recommendation to the Transportation Subcommittee for a geospatial data specification applying to road features.  

#### VII.  Procedures  
Subcommittee meetings shall be held at the call of the RSWG Chairperson and shall be held as needed. Most meetings will be held via teleconference since the members are not co-located in a single location.   
All decisions regarding the USRS shall be by the voting members of the RSWG. When unanimous decision is not reached, the issue will have a “pending” status until resolution.  
The RSWG may establish additional rules and procedures for conducting business.  

#### VIII.  Reports  
The RSWG shall provide updates to its status and activity during the Transportation Subcommittee meetings.  
The RSWG shall present the recommended USRS to the Transportation Subcommittee at the completion of its life-cycle.  

#### IX. Termination  
The RSWG shall remain in existence until terminated by the Transportation Subcommittee or until the RSWG determines it has completed its useful tenure.
