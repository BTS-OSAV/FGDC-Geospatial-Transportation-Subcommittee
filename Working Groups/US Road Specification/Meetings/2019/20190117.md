Agenda
9:30 - 10:00: Introduction
Group introduction
Review workshop goals
Identify the essential objects needed to identify, locate, and classify roads.
Identify the essential attributes needed to the describe objects defined in item.

Discussion of simple and complex features
We are using ISO 14825 to help us define the base road specification.
ISO 14825 defines Geographic Data Files for Intelligent Transport Systems.
GDFs are comprised of objects and features.
GDFs define four feature categories; point, line, areas, and complex.
Simple features are points, lines, and areas.
Complex features are aggregations of other simple features, complex features, or a combination of both.
These objects and features are divided across 3 levels.
Level 0 represents the topological primitive building blocks of Node, Edge, and Face.
Level 1 represents simple features such as points, lines, and areas.
Level 2 represents complex features. 
This working group has required that data meeting the base specification shall be accessible and easy to exchange.  To meet those requirements, we will only consider level 1 features for the base specification.
Ground Rules 
Be Respectful
No talking over each other
No Acronyms
Try to have fun
Speak up for those on the phone
Define what the base spec is - not how to implement
Parking lot for ideas for later discussion
