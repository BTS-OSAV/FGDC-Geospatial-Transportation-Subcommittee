Purpose
Status Update
Discuss and review the attributes submitted for the Inventory Use Case
Discuss next steps

Status
Attribute Collection
The attributes for the inventory use case have been collected and stored consolidated in this google document. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDEGQ3Z8tiqUcqppCJGSUAyLy1tLVmEgRUsuR1Qp7gk/edit

The collected attributes have been added to the following google sheet for review and categorization.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xw335aPuK8oGs8er7AVs1is4ZmziCa4w1WqKWgUbrGA/edit#gid=0




Next steps
Consolidate the attributes 
Identify duplicate attributes and find a common name for them.  Eg. Functional Class, Road Class, and Road Classification all store the same data.  These kinds of fields need to be identified and a common name found for all of them.
Check Categorization of attributes.
To help organize the attributes I have grouped them by the following categories.  Are they appropriate?  Should there be more?  Should there be fewer?

Identity
Describes the how the road is identified
Type
Describe the kind of road.
Location
Describes where the road is.
Use
Describes how the road is used.
Authority
Describes organizations responsible for the road.
Flow
Describes how traffic traverses the road
Routing
Describes how traffic is controlled.
Metadata
Describes information about the road data
Characteristic
Describes physical attribute about the road

Are they ready to be forwarded this to the TSC for review?

Open Discussion
Agreed on consolidation of attributes
Agreed on finding a common name for attributes.
Agreed that the working group should make a recommendation for each attribute
Required
Optional
Rejected
Define the USRN and its purpose
Define the MCG and its purpose
Have common identifiers (attributes?) that can be shared across sources so the can be linked across data sets and organizations
Many states don't want the responsibility of assigning/maintaining road names 
State DOTs don’t consider themselves the authoritative source of road names
Who is the authoritative source for road names
Addressing needs to be addressed. (Ha!)
Canadian NRN captures address ranges. 
Is this a non issue with the National Address Database.
How does the USRN and NAD play together
Greatest Service to the nation is high quality, minimalist, and scalable.  
How can other orgs hook their data into the MCG.  
MCG should be the base to which other organizations can add to.
Create a national center line dataset 
What’s holding keeping us getting there.
E.g. state to state connections
Convince local players to participate
How does DOT make the data collected (e.g. HPMS, NHPN) the authoritative source of road data
Networking attributes optional for analysis purposes
From States perspective: Asset management and maintenance is primary motivation.  
Efforts to create or maintain attributes that don't support this mission are superfluous.
Include network interconnectivity for future use…
A spec defining what’s needed for interconnectivity and routing would be welcome by some dots (DDOT)
States would look for funding for inclusion of extra attributes.like street names and interconnectivities between states
AL internal street name needs met by conflating with OSM data to AL data
A lot of money spent on TIGER why do companies spend their own money on commercial road networks (here, tom-tom).  Why?  We don’t compete with TIGER by providing HQ data from the source.

Closing
Next Meeting? Middle October. 

Review of MCG Strategy
The NRN working group was established at the GIS-T conference in April 2017
At the meeting Tom Roff (FHWA) and Sharon Hawkins were elected as the co-chairs of the working group
The working group’s first task will be to define a minimum content guideline for the USRN
The MCG will identify which attributes make the National Road Network meaningful to the Transportation Community
A list of use cases for the NRN was brainstormed at the GIS-T conference
Study each use case to determine what attributes are needed to fulfill its purpose.
The attributes essential to fulfilling  the use cases will be used to define the MCG.
The inventory attributes will be submitted to the transportation sub committee for review and acceptance.
After the inventory attributes have been accepted the NRN working group will discuss if the content meets the needs of the MCG.
If not the process will continue with the review of the planning and safety use cases.
