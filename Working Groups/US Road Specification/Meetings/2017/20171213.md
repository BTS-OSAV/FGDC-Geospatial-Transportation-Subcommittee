3. Agenda  

3.1 Development Strategy  
Sticking with the Object Oriented Database Design because it’s scalable and modular  
I am emulating the Canadian Model.  
Overview and Downloads  
http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3d282116-e556-400c-9306-ca1a3cada77f  
Documentation  
http://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/vector/geobase_nrn_rrn/doc/  
We will not copy it but use it as a pattern on which we can hang American attributes  
Why?  
The model meets our needs; Why Reinvent the wheel.   
Speed the Process - By adapting the canadian model we can focus our time defining content.  
By adapting the Canadian Model we can quickly advance storage, geometry and accuracy discussions.  
By adapting the Canadian Model we can start building a North American Network (Compatible standards resulting in an international network)  

3.2 Review of Proposed Content

| Date Created | Metadata | Date Created | 
| Date Revised | Metadata | Date Revised |
|State_FIPS | Transportation Segment | State in which the segment is located (Not sure this belongs here.  May move it to Road Segment Class) Use State FIPS? |
|County_Parish_FIPS | Transportation Segment | County/Parish in which the segment is located (Not sure this belongs here.  May move it to Road Segment Class)  Use County FIPS? | 
Functional Class | Transportation Segment | Road classification (FHWA is firm on functional classes)  Add to FHWA Domain  More than 2 classification systems Census Classification Codes  FHWA Classification Codes  Fed Lands Classification Codes  Federal Agency Roads on Fed Lands - Tammy Ratliff  Contact Saady Palma @ Eastern Fed Lands  National Park Service Classification Codes  USACE? BLM? Forest Service? Fish and Wildlife?  FHWA asked asked Facility Type to be included with Functional Classes  How will ramps BE handled?  Definition of a ramp? |
|Name | Transportation Segment | Name of the segment (Do we need Name and Number fields? Why not just 1 field?)  Text datatype  Standard naming conventions |   
| Number | Transportation Segment | Number of the segment (Do we need Name and Number fields? Why not just 1 field?)  <br /> Integer datatype Standard numbering convention | 
| Jurisdiction | Transportation Segment | Organization responsible for upkeep <br />  How to handle overlap of jurisdiction? |
| Signing | Road Segment | How the road is signed | 
| Qualifier | Road Segment | Description of road for Signing |   
| Status | Road Segment | Is the road usable (Other road states?)  Opened, Closed, Seasonal, Existing, Planned, Private  Further discuss the Domain of Status  Check Federal Highway for traffic counts, coverage |
| Speed Limit | Road Segment | Fastest lawful speed on road | 
| Surface | Road Segment | Type of road surface | 
| Through Lanes | Road Segment | Number of lanes designated for through traffic | 
| Traffic Direction | Road Segment | Direction of Traffic allowed on the road |
