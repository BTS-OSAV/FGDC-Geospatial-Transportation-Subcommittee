5. Updates
5.1. Charter Update   
From Ken Shafer   
With the Geospatial Data Act now in affect, we'll have to update most of the charters
with new wording to align to the new requirements. I suggest we wait until after the
GDA Tiger Team performs its analysis of the GDA then update all the required charters
at that point. Does that work for you? It should not impact the sub committee's work in
the meantime.

5.2. US Road Network Specification (USRNS) Working Group   
The Working Group is reviewing the features and attributes included in ISO 14825:2011
Our next meeting will be a facilitated face to face meeting to select which features and
attributes will be used to model road location, road identification, and road classification.
I’m pushing that meeting to mid January to because the FHWA is conducting a series of safety
meetings that might impact our work.   
I’m working on securing space at the Keck center in DC.

5.3. GIS-T 2019 Federal Track Update   
The idea has been presented to the GIS-T planning committee and was well received.
The planning committee is still considering the schedule so we are on stand-by.
We’re organizing a group of Federal GIS topics for the 2019 GIS-T conference in Kissimee, FL
from April 23-26 2019

What we do   
Working groups   
GDA (Or separate pres?)   
5.3.11. OST - Data integration for roadway safety   
OST Policy created an integrated dataset to develop a risk tool, NHTSA is
working with FHWA to align FARS to HPMS to perform network risk analysis (via
ESRI), and FHWA more generally is encourages Data Driven Safety Analysis
through integrated crash, roadway attribute, and traffic volume data.   
5.3.12. Maritime Admin?   
5.3.13. Fed Motor Carrier?   
5.3.14. Fed Transit?   
5.3.15. Fed Lands Working Group?   
5.4. Federal Land Roads (FLR) Working Group Update - Gita Urban-Mathieux   
Oct 3rd Meeting - Tom Roff & Tammy Ratcliff presented on work at FHWA

Next meeting Dec. 5th - Trails to be discussed at the next meetings   
Potential meeting Thursday 31st of January for FLRWR after ESRI Fed UC   
Action: Derald Chat with Gita about coordinating   
5.5. Intercity Busing (ICB) Working Group Update - Derald Dudley   
The ICB WG is working to establish a Intercity Busing layer which will be integrated with
the Intermodal Passenger Connectivity Database and the National Transit Map.
The MOU that creates and agreement between bus provides and the Bureau of
transportation statistics has been finalized.   
FGDC TSC Meeting 2018.10.17   
The MOU tells BTS where the data is and grants BTS the authorization to collect,
compile, analyze, publish, and archive the data.   
The Intercity Bus Atlas website is live and we are collecting intercity bus data from
registrants.   
https://www.bts.gov/geospatial-portal/intercity-busing/intercity-bus-atlas   
Future efforts include providing “near miss” analysis which will identify where the
intercity bus routes and transit routes are proximal but not intersecting. This will be
used to identify potential connections. We are also looking at using GTFS to produce
route bulletins. The bulletins would alert companies to route changes and closures.   
5.6. Transit Working Group   
Im considering combining the intercity bus working group and the transit working group
into the passenger travel working group.   
5.7. The Best Practices Working Group is still on my wish list. Would anyone like to chair it?
I have a use case! A small rural transit agency is being sued because it changed it routes.
The plaintiff claims the new routes are discriminatory. How can we use the National
Transit Map and the Census Demographic data to documents the people served by
existing and proposed transit routes?   
Is there any interest in a joint BTS and Census study/white paper?   
GDA of 2018: (E) as part of administering the National Geospatial Data Asset data
theme— …. (vi) identify and publish proven practices for the use and application of
geospatial data of the lead covered agency.   
  ● Best practices in calculating populations with in transportation catchments
  ● Population in Catchments around transportation features - (USDOT)
  ● Best practices of calculating populations affected by regional phenomena (Census)
  ● Any other best practices activities? What other analysis do others perform with
transportation data? (eg Transportation and Population, Land Use, Economy?)   
5.8. Potential TSC Transportation Talks for future meetings.

The steering committee is forming an interagency team to analyze the Geospatial Data Act and
assess the impacts, changes, LOE and path forward for implementation. The FGDC is adding a
web page with info and docs on the GDA, to be announced soon.
