&nbsp; &nbsp; ● The initial notification process for proposed changes will be accomplished via an email
from the NGDA Theme Lead to the FGDC Office of the Secretariat (OS) which currently
maintains the official NGDA Dataset Inventory.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● Updates on proposed changes will be shared and considered by the FGDC Coordination
Group and Theme Leads on a monthly basis.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● The FGDC Steering Committee will review recommendations for action as part of the
NGDA Portfolio management process.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● FGDC Steering Committee review and endorsement are required for dataset addition,
dataset removal, and moving a dataset from one NGDA theme to another, but are
not required for dataset changes.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● Once the FGDC Steering Committee endorses a change it will be incorporated into the
official NGDA Dataset Inventory and the online lists will be updated accordingly.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● To Remove NGDA Dataset the NGDA Theme Lead shall send the information listed
below to the FGDC OS (fdgc@fgdc.gov).   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ NGDA Theme: <theme name>   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ NGDA Theme Lead: <name, agency, contact information>   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ NGDA Dataset: <dataset name>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ NGDA Dataset Manager: <name, agency, contact information>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ Justification: <rationale for removal>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ Archive <plan>

6.2. US Road Network Specification (USRNS) Working Group   
11 April 2018: The USRNS working group agreed to delay voting on the adoption the Conceptual
Data Model Schema, the Geometric Model, and the Positional Accuracy, included in the of the
Canadian National Road Network until a formal definition of the network and a mission
statement could be written and reviewed.   
It’s also been brought to the committee’s attention that there is a lack of State DOT
representation. We will use this time to increase State DOT participation.
