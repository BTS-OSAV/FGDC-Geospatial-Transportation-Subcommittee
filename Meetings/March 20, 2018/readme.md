6.2. Please note the name change from US Road Network - Minimum Content Guideline
(USRN-MCG) to US Road Network Specification (USRNS).   
Why: The term specification more accurately describes what we building and instills
more confidence than the term guideline.   
6.3. We propose to adapt the Canadian National Road Network   
6.4. Benefits of Adaptation  
6.4.1. It meets the requirements defined by this working group.

6.4.2. It quickly advances the efforts of this working group by relying on accepted
standards. We are not reinventing the wheel; we’re modifying it to meet our
needs.   
6.4.3. It initiates an international specification.  
Well done and thank you Canada! Let’s talk to Mexico.  
6.4.4. It starts the process of establishing a data centric development model and
moves us away from an application centric development model  
6.5. Our Canadian Colleagues presented the Canadian National Road Network (NRN) for
review by the USRNs-WG on 7 February 2018  
6.5.1. Canadian NRN Specifications:

6.5.3. Canadian NRN Conceptual Data Model (Schema)  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15TPKaLLieF-OKhnRQ6DeZxV0dMnqCUtS/view?usp=sharing  
6.6. The USRNS - Working Group discussed the NRN on 23 February 2018 which resulted in
the following actions items.  
6.6.1. The WG will vote on April 11th about adopting the conceptual model (schema,
relationships, data types etc.), the geometric model, and the position accuracy
specification.   
6.6.1.1. Conceptual Model

https://drive.google.com/file/d/19b1fe5aWTpIT51dbm2qZZHvd8ut2GJ56/view?usp=sharing  
6.6.2. An updated project schedule will be provided at the 4/11 meeting.  
6.6.3. The WG will have until November 2018 to review the attributes in the NRN
specification.  
6.7. The comments on the proposed USRNS attributes have been received (thank you) and
reviewed. They will be considered for inclusion of version 1 of the USRNS.
