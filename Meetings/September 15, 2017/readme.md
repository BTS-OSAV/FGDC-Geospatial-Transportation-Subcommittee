6.	TSC Updates   
6.1.	US Road Network - Minimum Content Guideline (USRN – MCG) Update   
6.1.1.	Attribute Collection

6.1.3.	Next steps  
6.1.3.1.	Consolidate the attributes   
Identify duplicate attributes and find a common name for them.  Eg. Functional Class, Road Class, and Road Classification all store 
the same data.  These kinds of fields need to be identified and a common name found for all of them.  
6.1.3.2.	Cochair review  
USRN MCG Working Group Co-chairs will review and make recommendations for each attribute.  Recommendations include and attribute 
be required, optional, or rejected.  
Those recommendations will be forwarded to the TSC in December.  
6.2.	Charter Update  
6.2.1.	We will incorporate the last comments this month and have the charter ready for TSC review in November.  
6.3.	Best Practices Discussion   
6.3.1.	Still on my wish list.  I’m going to finish the Charter update before starting this.
