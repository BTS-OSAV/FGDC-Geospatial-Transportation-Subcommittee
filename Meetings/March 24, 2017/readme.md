&nbsp; &nbsp;•	FHWA-NHTSA FARS (Fatal Accident Reporting System) data integration efforts are forthcoming which will ultimately support various TPM-related efforts  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	ARNOLD accuracy specifications require further discussion; existing ARNOLD structure/schema includes year of record, unique route identifier, State Code, and geometry information  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	ARNOLD, in its current format, does not support autonomous vehicle-related initiatives  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	Topological requirements for ARNOLD need to be discussed/determined  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	Other Federal agencies’ (i.e., non-DOT) needs/requirements of ARNOLD need to be gathered/discussed  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	The feasibility non-LRS-based requirements from other Federal agencies requires discussion  

ARNOLD Minimum Content Standard Discussion (D. Dudley / S. Lewis)  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	TSC subgroups need to be established for the purpose of developing minimum content standard  
&nbsp; &nbsp;•	Use-cases for minimum content standard need to be assembled per feedback gathered from the TSC’s various partnering entities
