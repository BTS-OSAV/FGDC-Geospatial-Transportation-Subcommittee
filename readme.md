## FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee

**The Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee (GTC) enhances the Transportation Theme of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure by facilitating partnerships, coordinating efforts, and heightening awareness among the geospatial-transportation community. The committee promotes best practices and develops transportation standards to improve data quality, accessibility, exchange, and interoperability. Ultimately, the TSC cultivates a greater understanding of the American transportation system by providing accurate and timely information to American decision makers.**
